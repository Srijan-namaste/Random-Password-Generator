# Random-Password-Generator
It is a Î²eta version, that allows you to generate random passwords
& allows you to choose whether you want to include Upper Case,
Lowercase, Numbers, symbols, all of them together, or some of them.
Although it lacks customizability on the user end that will be fixed
in later versions.
